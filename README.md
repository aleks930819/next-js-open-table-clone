## About The Project

This project is a clone of the Open Table website. It is built with Next.js, Prisma, Material UI, Tailwind CSS, and Axios. The purpose of this project is to learn how to use Next.js and Prisma. I also wanted to learn how to use Material UI and Tailwind CSS together. I used Axios to make API calls to the backend.
